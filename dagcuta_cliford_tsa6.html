                   <h2>"Familiar of Zero" (Japanese: "Zero no Tsukaima") is a Japanese light novel series written by Noboru Yamaguchi and illustrated by Eiji Usatsuka,
                     which has been adapted into a popular anime series. The story is set in a magical world where students at the Tristain Academy of Magic summon familiars—magical creatures or beings that assist them.

                     The series follows their adventures, exploring themes of personal growth, magic, and the evolving bond between master and familiar.</h2>
